    description2: "I grew up in a military family, the newly emerging computer labs were my favorite way to spend my time, as was my ‘Commodore 64’ at home. I've enjoyed trying to ‘hack’ any device possible to increase its capabilities. I began coding by attempting to improve other's scripts so it would work the way I'd like, whether it personalize forum bots or when working for MTurk (crowdsourcing) to increase my productivity and income. After going through some programmin books and courses on my own, I’ve recently been able to greatly increase and cement my knowledge with an immersive coding bootcamp and am excited to take the next step!",
